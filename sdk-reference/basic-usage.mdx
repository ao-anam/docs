## Installation

Install the SDK in your project using npm: 

```bash
npm install @anam-ai/sdk
```

## Local Development

The quickest way to start using the SDK is with a local development setup:
<Warning>
  This example uses the `unsafe_createClientWithApiKey` method. This is not recommended for production use as it exposes your API key. See the [Usage in Production](/guides/get-started/production) guide for secure implementation.
</Warning>
```typescript
import { unsafe_createClientWithApiKey } from '@anam-ai/js-sdk';

const anamClient = unsafe_createClientWithApiKey('your-api-key', {
  personaId: 'chosen-persona-id',
});

// Start streaming to video and audio elements
await anamClient.streamToVideoAndAudioElements(
  'video-element-id',
  'audio-element-id'
);
```
<Note>
  If you haven't already created your own persona, you can use one of our [default personas]() to get started.
  Try Leo, the AI receptionist with the ID `773a8ca8-efd8-4449-9305-8b8bc1591475`.
</Note>

## DOM Elements

This quickstart example requires two DOM elements to stream to:

- A video element to play the video stream of your persona
- An audio element to play the voice stream of your persona

For this example we would include the following in our HTML:

```html
<video id="video-element-id" autoplay playsinline></video>
<audio id="audio-element-id" autoplay></audio>
```
<Note>
  `autoplay` is used to start the stream as soon as the page loads.
  The `playsinline` attribute prevents the video from being played in fullscreen mode on mobile devices.
</Note>

## Stopping a Stream

To stop an active session, use the `stopStreaming` method. This will end the current session and release the audio and video elements.

```typescript
await anamClient.stopStreaming();
```
