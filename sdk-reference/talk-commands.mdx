## Basic Usage

Sometimes during a persona session, you may wish to force a response from the persona. For example, when the user interacts with an element on the page or when you have disabled the Anam LLM to use your own. To do this, use the `talk` method: 

```typescript
await anamClient.talk('Hello, how are you?');
```

This will force the persona to respond with the given text.

<Note>
  To learn more about how to use the `talk` method to enable your own custom intelligence, see our [Custom Brains](/guides/personas/custom-brains) guide.
</Note>

## Streaming Talk Input

For more advanced use cases, you can stream messages to the persona in multiple chunks. This is particularly useful when streaming output from a custom LLM to reduce latency.

```typescript
const talkMessageStream = anamClient.createTalkMessageStream();

const chunks = ['He', 'l', 'lo', ', how are you?'];

for (const chunk of chunks) {
  if (talkMessageStream.isActive()) {
    talkMessageStream.streamMessageChunk(
      chunk,
      chunk === chunks[chunks.length - 1]
    );
  }
}
```
<Note>
  One talkMessageStream represents one "turn" in the conversation. Once that turn is over, the stream can no longer be used and you must create a new `TalkMessageStream`.
</Note>

### End of Speech and Interruptions

A conversation "turn" can end in one of two ways:

1. **End of speech**: When `streamMessageChunk` is called with `endOfSpeech: true` or the `endMessage()` method is called
2. **User interruption**: When the user speaks during the stream, triggering an `AnamEvent.TALK_STREAM_INTERRUPTED` event

In both cases, the `TalkMessageStream` object is closed and no longer usable. You can check if a stream is still active using:
```typescript
if (talkMessageStream.isActive()) {
  // Stream is still active
}
```

## Correlation IDs

For tracking purposes, you can attach a correlation ID to your talk streams by passing the optional `correlationId` parameter to the `createTalkMessageStream` method:
```typescript
const talkMessageStream = anamClient.createTalkMessageStream("unique-id-123");
```

<Note>
  The `correlationId` should be unique for every `TalkMessageStream` instance. When a talk stream is interrupted, this ID will be included in the `AnamEvent.TALK_STREAM_INTERRUPTED` event.
