You can interact with the Anam API through HTTP requests using your Anam API key. If you don't already have your API key, or if you need to create a new one, see [Managing API keys](/guides/get-started/api-key).

## Authentication

All requests to the Anam API must be authenticated using your API key. Each request should include an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <your_api_key>`.

For example, to authenticate a request to the `GET /v1/personas` endpoint using your API key `1234567890` you would include the following header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.anam.com/v1/personas" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 1234567890" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
