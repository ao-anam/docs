## Get your API Key
Your API key is used to authenticate your requests to the Anam API and is required for integrating the Personas you create into your application
You get your first API key when you sign up for Anam. If you need a new API key, you can create one using the Anam Lab.
<Note>
  All users are automatically invited to join the Anam Lab when they sign up for Anam. If you signed up but haven't received an invite, please contact us at [support@anam.ai](mailto:support@anam.ai).
</Note>

## Managing API keys with the Anam Lab
From the Anam Lab home page, click on the "API keys" tab. Here you can see a list of all your existing API keys and remove any that you wish to delete.

### Create a new API key
To create a new API key, click on the "Create API key" button. This will open a modal where you can give your new API key a label.
<Note>
  The label is only used to help you identify the API key. It is not used for authentication.

Click "Create" and your new API key will be shown to you. Remember to save it somewhere safe as you will not be able to access it later.
You will be prevented from closing the dialog until you have clicked the "Copy" button.

<Warning>
  Anam encrypts and store your API keys securely. For this reason, we are unable to recover your API keys if you lose them.
  If you do lose your API key, you will need to create a new key via the Anam Lab.
</Warning>

## Using your API key
Now that you have your API key, you can use it to integrate a persona into your application or perform actions via the Anam API.
