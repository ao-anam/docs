## What are Personas?

Personas are AI powered digital humans that can be integrated into your applications using the Anam JavaScript SDK. Each persona is designed with specific characteristics and capabilities to handle different use cases and roles.

## Managing Personas

Personas can be managed through the [Anam Lab](https://lab.anam.ai) or via the [Anam API](https://api.anam.ai/api). With either method you can:
- List available personas for your account
- View detailed information about specific personas
- Create custom personas with unique configurations

## Types of Personas

### Default Personas
Every Anam account has access to pre-defined 'default personas', which can be used immediately or used as a guide for creating your own custom personas. When first integrating Anam with your product we recommend starting with a default persona.

### Custom Personas
Custom personas are created by you and can be used in the same way as default personas. With a custom persona you have control over:
- Name and description
- Persona preset (defining face and voice)
- Brain configuration (system prompt, personality, and filler phrases)

## Getting Started

To start using personas in your application, you can:
1. Use one of our [default personas](/guides/personas/default-personas)
2. [Create your own persona](/guides/personas/create-your-own)
3. [Implement your own brain](/guides/personas/using-your-own-brains) for custom knowledge integration

## Best Practices

- Choose personas that align with your use case and brand identity
- Test personas in your target environment before deployment
- Consider your audience when selecting or creating persona characteristics
